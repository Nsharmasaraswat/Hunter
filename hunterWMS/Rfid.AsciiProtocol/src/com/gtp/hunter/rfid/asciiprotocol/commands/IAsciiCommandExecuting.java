 * Defines the responsibilities of classes that can execute and respond to a TSLAsciiCommand
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Responses to an executed TSLAsciiCommand (see executeCommand:) are handled through a responder chain (see responderChain)
 * The responder chain is an ordered list of TSLAsciiCommandResponder that is traversed from the first responder added to the last.
 * Each correctly terminated response line that has been received is passed to the TSLAsciiCommandResponder’s processReceivedLine: method.
 * If a responder returns YES from the processReceivedLine method then the traversal ends otherwise it continues until all responders have been visited.
